# Baby-Aid

## Description
Baby Aid was created to allow parents with kids of all ages from newborn to 18 to be able to have a safe enviroment to ask questions and receive answers from other parents. Not everyone has a support system around them that allows them to have the ability to get help if needed. In order to use the site you must create an account, once created you are then able to post questions as well as answer fellow parents questions. You are also able to vote on both the question and answer, which allows users to know which questions are the most common and which answers are the best solutions to the questions.
